      "letter": "Dear Benjamin Netanyahu,\n\nYou are an evil and masochistic person. The ceasefire deal has been signed, so it is time to stop the genocide in Palestine. Millions of innocent women and children are being torn apart by your commands, targeting hospitals and schools. It is time to stop. As the Prime Minister of the Jewish state of Israel, who gave you the right to kill innocent people en masse?\n\nSince the ceasefire deal, more than 100 Palestinians have died from military action by the Israeli military, mostly children, women, and elderly people. Despite the deal, your government has made no effort to enforce it and has broken the policy countless times; this isn’t just a war anymore, it is a genocide. Not to mention, most airstrike targets on your agenda are full of residential areas, schools, and hospitals—trust me, no military is crazy enough to station their troops there. If this isn’t racism, what is it?\n\nThis is truly terrible.\n\nSure, the Allies bombed German and Japanese residential areas all the time, but that was seven decades ago; things have changed. And do not try to legitimize your actions by comparing them to WWII; they carpet-bombed, while you target specific areas with precision technology. Families torn apart, lives ruined, opportunities taken away—it carries on even when ceasefire deals are signed. You are truly a terrible, racist, masochistic person. How would you feel if your own family were bombed to nothingness? Terrible, isn’t it?\n\nStriking innocent people will only ruin your reputation and derail what you claim is a war into a full-on genocide campaign. Stop before it's too late.\n\nSam",
